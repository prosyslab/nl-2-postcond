Your task is to write a ${toGenerateFull} for ${entrypoint}. The ${toGenerateShort} should be in Python and consist of exactly one assert statement.

For variables, the ${toGenerateShort} should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, ${entrypoint}) within the ${toGenerateShort}.

If the ${toGenerateShort} calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the ${toGenerateShort} should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your ${toGenerateShort} should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a ${toGenerateShort} that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a ${toGenerateShort} that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a ${toGenerateShort} that checks both of these things.
