Instead, assume that the function has already been called and its return value is available in a variable called `return_value` that you can use. In the postcondition, only use functions that are part of the functional subset of python (e.g., all(), len(), map(), filter(), etc.).

${codeStubAndDocstring}

Your task is to write a ${toGenerateFull} for ${entrypoint}. The ${toGenerateShort} should be in Python and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the ${toGenerateShort}'s meaning should precede it. For variables, the ${toGenerateShort} should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's re (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are necessary, include the corresponding imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, ${entrypoint}) within the ${toGenerateShort}.

If the ${toGenerateShort} calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the ${toGenerateShort} should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your ${toGenerateShort} should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a ${toGenerateShort} that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a ${toGenerateShort} that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a ${toGenerateShort} that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the ${toGenerateFull} checks

The ${toGenerateShort} should hold true whenever the function ${entrypoint} executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of the eventual internal implementation of the function.
